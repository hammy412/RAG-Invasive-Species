They are often referred to as \u201cexotic,\u201d \u201calien,\u201d \u201cintroduced,\u201d or \u201cnon-native\u201d species.\nIn their natural range, these plants are limited by factors that keep them in balance including pests, herbivores, or diseases. However, when introduced into an area where these limitations are absent, some species can become invasive.\nImpact of Invasive Plants\nInvasive plants reduce habitat for native wildlife. Invasive plants out-compete natives and \u201ctake over\u201d native plants\u2019 habitats.",

Invasive plants out-compete natives and \u201ctake over\u201d native plants\u2019 habitats.\nThey often emerge earlier in the spring and push natives out through fast reproduction. This limits habitat available for native wildlife and disrupts the food chain.\nOne example is the invasive plant, garlic mustard. Native butterflies lay eggs on garlic mustard, and they either die or the caterpillars don\u2019t properly grow.\nOther ecological impacts include:\n-\nChanges in availability of water, light, and nutrients\n-\nDisruption of native plant-pollinator relationships\n-\nServing as host reservoirs for plant pathogens\n-\nReplacing nutritious native plant foods with lower quality sources\n-\nKilling trees and shrubs through girdling\n-\nChanges in the rate of soil erosion",

But by taking some steps at home and in the wild, you can help limit the spread of these troublesome plants.\n-\nPlant natives. The key to controlling invasives is to promote healthy native plant communities. By keeping a native healthy ecosystem on your property, invasives will have less opportunity to invade. Planting native species, using local nurseries that provide native alternatives, and choosing the right species for the site can all help limit invasives. Learn more about planting with natives.\n-",

By limiting ground disturbance on your property, you can minimize invasives spreading to your area. Also, make sure any fill material you use (rocks, soil, mulch, etc.) is free from weed seeds. This can be a source of invasives on a property.\n-\nUse fertilizers wisely. How much fertilizer do you need? You might be giving invasives an advantage by over-fertilizing. First, start with a soil test before applying fertilizer. Instead of chemical fertilizer, try using organic, slow-decomposing compost and mulches. Better yet, make your own compost by saving vegetable peels and table scraps. This saves waste and creates healthy soil.\n-",

When you notice a problem species, take action.\n-\nAct fast. It is most effective to treat invasive populations when they are still small and easily controllable. For instance, do not let invasive plants go to seed. Mechanical removal through digging or cutting is preferred. Large populations of invasives may need to be stopped chemically with spot applications of herbicide by trained individuals or by homeowners carefully following label instructions.

Meadows in Pennsylvania may need to be mowed every year. Woodlands are probably the lowest-maintenance landscape, but they too will need to be monitored and invasive plants removed.
